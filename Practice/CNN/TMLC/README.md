In this project I worked on [102 Category Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/) and I tried different ways to create a good model:
 - A Simple CNN model having 5 hidden layers.
 - Another CNN model with Hyperparameter Tuning using [Keras-Tuner](https://keras.io/keras_tuner/) (Unfortunately it didn't work, taking infinite amount of time)
 - Model with concept of Transfer Learning using VGG16
