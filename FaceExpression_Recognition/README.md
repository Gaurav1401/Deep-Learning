### AIM:
To predict the expression of the given image as:
 - angry
 - disgust
 - fear
 - happy
 - neutral
 - sad
 - surprise

### Steps Followed
 - Downloading and Unzipping the data.
 - Extracting labels from the image paths.
 - Converting all images and labels to tensorflow objects
 - Resizing and Rescaling
 - Data Augmentation
 - Prediction using transfer learning(EfficientNetB2)

### Future Work
The above model can be further used for real time face expression prediction using OpenCV library.
